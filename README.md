# code-completion-evaluation
A dataset and evaluation framework for code completion using machine learning models. It includes scripts for generating code completion examples, running a model, and assessing its performance against annotated completions.

1. Manually show result for math_dataset and plot graph
2. Try three different metrics, for entire dataset
3. Do unit test metric for func_gen_accuracy
